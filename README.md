# Note:
This is my old website project.\
The repository was previously under the Samyar Projects organization, but I've decided to move it here before archiving it.\
I don't currently have any plans for a new website, and this one hasn't seen active development in a while...

*1: If you don't know how to modify your hosts file, take a look at this guide: https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/<br>
<br>
*2: If you don't know how to get a Google Analytics tracking ID, take a look at this guide: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en&ref_topic=9303319#zippy=%2Cfind-your-g--id-for-any-platform-that-accepts-a-g--id (NOTE: You will be creating the data stream for Web. In the 'Set up data collection' section, go down to 'Find your "G-" ID' then follow those steps and get your G- ID)<br>
<br>
*3: To get this file, create a 'Google Cloud Platform' project, enable the 'Analytics Data API' in the project, go to the 'Credentials' section, create a 'Service Account' and finally go to the 'Keys' tab on your Service Account page then create and download a JSON key.<br>
<br>
*4: To get the Mailjet credentials: Create a Mailjet account, go to 'Account Settings > API Key Management' then create an API key.<br>
